# Tattoo-Site
Tattoo art website
This project is a website dedicated to tattoo art projects.

The site is written in HTML, CSS and JS, the site looks beautiful, since it uses a pleasant and slow scrolling, and smooth appearance of photos and text.

In order to use this site you need to download the "Live Server" application and you can see how this site works. If you are too lazy to do these machinations, you can look at the review of the site in my telegram channel
