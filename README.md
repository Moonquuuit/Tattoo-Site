# Tattoo art website

This project is a website dedicated to tattoo art projects.

The site is written in HTML, CSS and JS. The site looks beautiful thanks to the use of pleasant and smooth scrolling, as well as the smooth appearance of photos and text.

To use this site, you need to download the "Live Server" extension and you will be able to see how this site works. If you are too lazy to do these manipulations, you can watch a review of the site in my telegram channel: https://t.me/MoonquitDeveloper/52
